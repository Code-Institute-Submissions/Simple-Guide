# Simple Travel Guide

This project focuses on providing the user with general information about food, attractions and events
in a specific city. It aims to inform the user on what they can expect when visiting a selected city, however, 
does not bring focus to specific businesses or locations. The project emphasises the overall **experience** to 
give insight that is vital to the user when making a decision on where to travel. 

## UX

This website is for people searching for inspiration for their next travel adventure, without the overload of 
information that comes with some blogs and/or other travel sites. It aims to provide the user with the general
 atmosphere of a location, rather then "10 Best Places to See in '#'. It gives the user freedom of exploration, 
without leaving them feel like they are obligated to go here or there.  

### User stories

* Hero images on each page intrigue the user and provoke further exploration;
* They are then met with a question of 'where' or 'what', enticing them to interact;
* From the home page the user gets brought to further information about their selected city;
* If their initian selection is not what they are looking for, they can navigate to other cities from the menu
bar;
* From engaging with the information they can choose "Lets Go" and will be brought to an external booking site;
* The home page also encourages for the user to share their experience, that would then be used to further 
develope the website and grow the information (adding destination, updating existing information);
* The user can also subscribe to a Newsletter, for information in any updated content;
* Finally, the user can follow the creator on external platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and/or Twitter;
